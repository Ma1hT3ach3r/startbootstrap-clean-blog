            <p>Skills vs. Competencies

After reading this section(pg.9 of 21st Century compentcies), I am firmly aware that there is a gaping hole in the notion of “skill” and “competency”, big enough to drive a giant purple elephant through without anyone even batting an eye.

When you don’t define things precisely using mathematics you end up with this huge yet subtle issue: words that are good enough to print but not good enough to guide.

Here is my example: consider a mathematics class where a teacher is teaching a concept, say trigonometry(easy and straight forward enough right?). The student asks “why should I believe anything you write down?”. The teacher responds: “because it is true.” And the student says, from their heart: “that does not feel good enough”. 

Lets consider where competencies and skills come in to this example: Are the students skills at mathematics just not good enough to understand what the teacher is teaching? Are the teacher’s competencies up to par to make the point?

There is clearly an issue here. If you have an answer to this please feel free to point this out to me. One thing you might be thinking is that “authority” might be part of the competency of the educator. But why should one have to appeal to authority when teaching mathematics? Should everything be completely tautological? By that I mean because it is true that student recognizes it and follows, in some form. 

Until there are better definitions of skills and competencies we will end up with this “nightmare” scenario playing out in classrooms all over the world. Where students never admit to learning and teachers never have to speak of the foundations. Meaning we can all continue in our zombie like trance towards: “job done”.

To begin this journey towards a better object oriented point of view, which I will do a poor man’s version of below, we will need to consider some basic structures needed to consider these notions of skill and competency: 

[ ] - when we see these brackets we will think about multi-sets. This means we will be able to have more than one of each element in the set.
{} – when we see these brackets we will think about sets. This means we will have only one of each element in this set, as a rule.

Instead of thinking about this as a “rule that is being made up” consider it apparatus to conceptualize the following solution to help the student, in the example, appreciate the difference between skill and competency to help her better appreciate the skills and competencies in question in the work at hand.

Teacher-“Well if that is not good enough then you are already using mathematics.”
Student-“What do you mean? I am questioning what you are doing which mean I am not engaging in mathematics.”
Teacher-“To engage in mathematics requires you to begin to identify the difference between objects I am presenting and the elements in your mind. Because you are critiquing me you are therefore interacting with objects I am presenting, considering and comparing them to elements you have in your mind and conceptualizing what mathematics ought to be.”
Student-“I suppose I am.”

One very interesting experience to consider is the ability to solve a rubiks cube, quickly. When you participate in this activity you will being to question this notion heavily, more than one might if one has not completed this task a variety of times and ways. 

I will elaborate more in further blog eateries about how the Rubik’s cube solves the problem of a consistent mathematical narrative across mathematics classrooms around the world.

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
