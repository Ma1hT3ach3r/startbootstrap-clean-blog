            <p>Skills vs. Competencies

After reading this section(pg.9 of 21st Century compentcies), I am firmly aware that there is a gaping hole in the notion of “skill” and “competency”, big enough to drive a giant purple elephant through without anyone even batting an eye.

When you don’t define things precisely using mathematics you end up with this huge yet subtle issue: words that are good enough to print but not good enough to guide.

Here is my example: consider a mathematics class where a teacher is teaching a concept, say trigonometry(easy and straight forward enough right?). The student asks “why should I believe anything you write down?”. The teacher responds: “because it is true.” And the student says, from their heart: “that does not feel good enough”. 

Lets consider where competencies and skills come in to this example: Are the students skills at mathematics just not good enough to understand what the teacher is teaching? Are the teacher’s competencies up to par to make the point?

There is clearly an issue here. If you have an answer to this please feel free to point this out to me. One thing you might be thinking is that “authority” might be part of the competency of the educator. But why should one have to appeal to authority when teaching mathematics? Should everything be completely tautological? By that I mean because it is true that student recognizes it and follows, in some form. 

Until there are better definitions of skills and competencies we will end up with this “nightmare” scenario playing out in classrooms all over the world. Where students never admit to learning and teachers never have to speak of the foundations. Meaning we can all continue in our zombie like trance towards: “job done”.

To begin this journey towards a better object oriented point of view, which I will do a poor man’s version of below, we will need to consider some basic structures needed to consider these notions of skill and competency: 

[ ] - when we see these brackets we will think about multi-sets. This means we will be able to have more than one of each element in the set.
{} – when we see these brackets we will think about sets. This means we will have only one of each element in this set, as a rule.

Instead of thinking about this as a “rule that is being made up” consider it apparatus to conceptualize the following solution to help the student, in the example, appreciate the difference between skill and competency to help her better appreciate the skills and competencies in question in the work at hand.

Teacher-“Well if that is not good enough then you are already using mathematics.”
Student-“What do you mean? I am questioning what you are doing which mean I am not engaging in mathematics.”
Teacher-“To engage in mathematics requires you to begin to identify the difference between objects I am presenting and the elements in your mind. Because you are critiquing me you are therefore interacting with objects I am presenting, considering and comparing them to elements you have in your mind and conceptualizing what mathematics ought to be.”
Student-“I suppose I am.”

One very interesting experience to consider is the ability to solve a rubiks cube, quickly. When you participate in this activity you will being to question this notion heavily, more than one might if one has not completed this task a variety of times and ways. 

I will elaborate more in further blog eateries about how the Rubik’s cube solves the problem of a consistent mathematical narrative across mathematics classrooms around the world.
